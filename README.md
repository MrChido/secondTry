This is my first lesson into React Native.

This whole project is me going along with my instruction, trying things out and saving them in the process.

This is a stealar idea (i think) because in the event that this current laptop no longer functions, i have a reserve copy of what i learned for future refrence and to have to something to work from.

If anybody else viewing this gets something out of this, kudos to them as well.(i dunno how but congrats)
